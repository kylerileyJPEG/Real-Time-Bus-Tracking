# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
# Description
This exercise uses the character from the popular Japanese "Pac-Man" video game franchise. This code does not create the actual PacMan game but instead clones the character within a box. Two options will be given, "start game" and "Add PacMan" - "Start Game" runs the program and "Add PacMan" clones the PacMan. The PacMen generated are given random speeds to move/bounce across the screen.
# How to Run
- Fork this exercise to your own Github
- Clone a copy to your IDE of choice
- Drag/open the file labeled "index.html" into your browser/live
- Click "Start Game"
- Click "Add PacMan"

# Roadmap of future improvements
- Use other characters other than "Pac Man"
- Have these characters interact with each other
