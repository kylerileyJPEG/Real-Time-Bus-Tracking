# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
# Description
This exercise uses data pulled from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to show a bird's-eye view of all the bus stops between MIT and Harvard. This code uses an API from MapBox in order to create the geopmap used to visualize the data. (Mapbox is a mapping and location cloud platform for developers).
# How to Run
- Fork this exercise to your own Github
- Clone a copy to your IDE of choice
- Drag/open the file labeled "index.html" into your browser/live
- Click "Show stops between MIT and Harvard"

# Roadmap of future improvements
